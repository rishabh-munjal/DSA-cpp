/*Given a string S such that it may contain repeated lowercase alphabets.
 Rearrange the characters in the string such that no two adjacent characters are same.
 

Example 1:

You do not need to read input or print anything. Complete the function rearrangeString() which takes string S as input parameter and returns the string after rearrangement.
If the characters are successfully rearranged then the generated output will be 1 else 0.


Expected Time Complexity : O(n log n)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(n)
